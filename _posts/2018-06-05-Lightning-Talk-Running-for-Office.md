We'll take a listen to a lightning talk that our host [Ryan Koch](https://twitter.com/ryan_koch) gave at the Code for America Summit in Oakland California last Friday (06/01/2018). The talk is focused on the idea of citizen technologists running for office making use of Ryan's own story as an example. It hopes serve as a point of inspiration for folks like you to take on a run of your own.
