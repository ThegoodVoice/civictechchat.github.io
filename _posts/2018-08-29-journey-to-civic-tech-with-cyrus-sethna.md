For this episode we talk to [Cyrus Sethna](https://twitter.com/c_sethna) about their journey into civic tech. Cyrus works in the [United States Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov/) and is an avid member of [Code for DC](https://codefordc.org/). We delve into that story, truths he's discovered along the way, and we learn about something called 'The National Day of Civic Crafting.' You won't want to miss this one.
